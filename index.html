            <h2>Latest Release: Are You Offended Yet? You'll Soon Be Encouraged.</h2>
            <p>The Poems helps remind us not to be so offended about things we and people 
                say and,or do. This is life as we've known it sense the beginning of the World. 
                Everyone thinks differently, some more than others. So we can't spend the rest of
                 our lives being offended or to make it more plain walking around with a chip on our shoulder.
                  There is hope for this world and the lives we live. It is encouragement through the word of God. 
                  And I always say, don't knock it until you've tried it. The word of God has never been wrong.</p>
